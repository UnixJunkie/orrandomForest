(** [train ?debug mode sparsity params data_fn labels_fn maybe_model_out_fn]
    will train a random forest using given parameters
    on the data in [data_fn] with labels in [labels_fn].
    If [maybe_model_out_fn] <> None, the trained model will be saved
    to the file with given name.
    [data_fn] is a numerical matrix dumped in a tab-separated text file
    without any format header.
    Dense or sparse matrices (in CSR format) are supported.
    Rows are observations, columns are features.
    If [mode = Classification], [labels_fn] must be a vector of tab-separated
    "1" or "-1" integer labels in a text file, without any format header.
    If [mode = Regression], [labels_fn] must be a text file with
    one float value per line.
    For classification, column [i] in [labels_fn] is the corresponding label
    of line [i] in [data_fn].
    For regression, line [i] in [labels_fn] is the corresponding value for
    line [i] in [data_fn]. *)
